                There are 3000 doors in a row, all doors are initially closed.<br> A person walks through all doors
                multiple times and toggle (if open then close, if close then open) them in the following way:
                <br> In the first walk, the person toggles every door In the second walk, the person toggles every
                second door, i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, … <br>In the third walk, the person toggles every third door,
                i.e. 3rd, 6th, 9th,…<br> And likewise,
                In the 3000th walk, the person toggles the 3000th door.<br> Can you help the Avengers by telling how
                many doors will be open in the end?
